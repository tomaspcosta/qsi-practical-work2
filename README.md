## **OWASP ASVS Requirement**

This project implements **OWASP ASVS Requirement 5.1.4**:
- **"Verify that structured data is strongly typed and validated against a defined schema including allowed characters, length, and pattern."**

### **Input Validation**
1. **Temperature Inputs**:
   - Ensures the input is a **numeric value** (rejecting special characters or strings).
   - Validates that the temperature is not below **absolute zero** (-273.15Â°C).
   
2. **Currency Inputs**:
   - Ensures the input is a **numeric value**.
   - Validates that the currency amount is **positive** and within a reasonable range.

## **Currency Exchange API Integration**

This application fetches real-time currency conversion rates from the **ExchangeRate API**. The current exchange rates are automatically retrieved through the API and used for currency conversions. This ensures that the exchange rates are always up-to-date and correct.

### **API Details**
- **API provider**: [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
- The API provides real-time conversion rates for multiple currencies, including EUR to USD, EUR to GBP, and others.
